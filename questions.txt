is three.js left or right handed?

when grouping objects and changing the scale of the group, can we read world scale (instead of the relative scale)?

how does window pixel ratio work when a window is between 2 screens?

(domelement).requestFullscren is this javascript/web api or a three.js function?

in chapter 8 bruno says we can't do: 
    if (!(document.fullscreenElement || document.webkitFullscreenElement))
instead we need to assign it to a variable and do
    const fullscreenElement = document.fullscreenElement || document.webkitFullscreenElement;
    if (!fullscreenElement)
why?
